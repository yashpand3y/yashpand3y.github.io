											<h2 class="major">Game Developer and QA Co-op</h2>
											<h3><a href="https://drexel.edu/soe/research/labs/glide-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GLIDE Labs</a><br />
												<i>September 2020 - March 2021</i></h3>
											
											<ul>
												<li>
													I worked on the AR/VR phone game Pasithea. 
													Paired with the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the player will explore the museum sections with interactive story-driven quests. 
													My responsibilities were multifaceted when I joined the team because it was a small team. 
													My duties involved QA on the existing code-base (successfully discovering and resolving critical bugs with the log-in functionality).
													 My can-do attitude and detail-oriented approach to the assigned tasks enabled me to go above and beyond.
												</li>
												<li>
													I used technologies like <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity3D</a>, 
													<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>, 
													<a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selenium WebDriver Python library</a>, 
													<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/landpa.html?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photoshop</a>, 
													and <a href="https://procreate.art/ipad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProCreate on iPad</a>.
												</li>
												<li>
													I was responsible for designing and developing the next quarter of the game, keeping in mind the themes present in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
													I used the skills gained from my previous co-op at Glenmede to automate scraping images of exhibits that cycled within the museum. 
													It enhanced our image dataset to improve our image-scanning feature. 
													I also ideated, designed, and suggested a UI overhaul (received very positively by the project head) within the game. 
													It would improve player immersion by thematically imposing the role of an explorer on the player (in line with how the story is presented).
												</li>
											</ul> 
										
											<h2 class="major">Data Scientist Co-op</h2>
											<h3><a href="https://www.glenmedeim.com/fixed-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenmede</a><br />
												<i>September 2019 - March 2020</i></h3>
											
											<ul>
												<li>
													I worked in the trading room with the Fixed Income team at Glenmede Investment Management. 
													I created automated scripts to collect, organize, and format data collected through various means for the traders and cyclic meetings. 
													Direct communication with the traders allowed me to analyze their needs and develop appropriate programming solutions.
												</li>
												<li>
													I used technologies like <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>, 
													<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas Python library</a>, 
													<a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Numpy Python library</a>, 
													<a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selenium WebDriver Python library</a>,
													<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS EC2</a>, 
													<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Lambda</a>, 
													and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Quicksight</a>.
												</li>
												<li>
													With the software practice instilled from my CI/CD experience at my previous co-op at IndustrySafe, I improved the efficiency of a data extraction process from 24 hours to 3 hours. 
													This process involved extracting data for 100,000 CUSIP data points from scraping websites. 
													I used the concept of self-modifying code to expedite this process.
													I also created python scripts to perform calculations to help traders make trades.
												</li>
												<li>
													I developed different parts of the ETL (extraction, transformation, loading) pipeline using AWS EC2, AWS Serverless (Lambda), and AWS Quicksight. 
													I created dashboards from the processed data, which the traders very positively received. 
													I was responsible for developing scripts to pre-process over 45 million data points for loading into the AWS EC2 instance.
												</li>
											</ul>

												<i>September 2018 - March 2019</i></h3>
											<ul>
												<li>
													I worked on their primary OSHA web reporting service. 
													The product allowed users to create, manage, and track different OSHA reports. 
													It also had a hierarchical employee-manager structure within users with varying visibility of forms.
												</li>
												<li>
													I used technologies like C#, HTML, and SQL.
												</li>
												<li>
													The product was developed in an Agile development environment. 
													I was responsible for fixing ticketed bugs (from clients) and discussed possible solutions for more significant issues.
													My fixes in SQL improved query times by 40%. 
													I also created and executed test plans to perform QA and report issues to the team-wide task list.
												</li>
												<li>
													In line with my nature to go above and beyond, I automated compiling weekly error reports through a C# script. 
													I decreased the time the task takes from 1 hour to a few seconds.

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>
								<li><h4>What is my story so far?</h4></li>
								<p>
									I was born in New Delhi, India, in 1999. At 22, I have lived (<i>spent at least three years</i>) in 4 countries - India (<b>1999 - 2007, 2015 - 2017</b>), Singapore (<b>2007 - 2010</b>), United Arab Emirates (<b>2010 - 2015</b>), and the United States (<b>2017 - Present</b>) - which has provided me with a unique global experience.
									<br />
									<br />
									I completed my 9th and 10th grades (first and second year of high school) at <a href="https://website.dpsdubai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delhi Private School - Dubai</a>. 
									I transferred to <a href="https://dpsnoida.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delhi Public School - Noida</a> to finish my 11th and 12th grades (third and fourth year of high school). 
									The different cultures, opportunities, and environments induced holistic growth, with traits such as adaptability, flexibility, and tenacity notably honed.
									<br />
									<br />
									Transferring schools from one country to the other never gets any easier. Despite the challenges, I put in the work to earn the A.J Drexel Scholarship which allowed me to attend <a href="https://drexel.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drexel University</a>.
								</p>
								<li><h4>What got me into programming?</h4></li>
								<p>
									I learned programming in 6th grade, which revealed my affinity for it. 
									Through 11th and 12th grade (junior and senior year of high school), I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turbo C++</a> as my first OOP language and SQL as my first DBMS language. 
									I enjoy the process of learning new concepts and ideas, which is what led me to make my first large project ever, Overlap. 
									<br />
									<br />
									My motivation came from my innate passion for solving problems and creating large systems to work together. 
									Through the development of Overlap, I pushed myself to learn concepts outside the outlined syllabus and taught myself how to use the graphics library to visualize the elements of the game. 
									I found that the process of programming games is similar to designing large systems and making sure they all interact with each other as intended. 
									My excellent understanding of the basic OOP programming concepts and data structures allowed me to design, program, and optimize the project to the highest level possible.
								</p>
								<li><h4>Why did I choose to study what I did?</h4></li>
								<p>
									My sentiment toward programming, combined with my success at creating a game in high school, inspired me to study computer science with a concentration in game programming and development. 
									I went on to further add an artificial intelligence track to my degree. 
									The concentration and track added extra classes to my graduation requirement along with the classes every Computer Science major took. 
									In line with my tendency to go above and beyond, I graduated with approximately two terms worth of extra courses. 
									<br />
									<br />
									Out of interest in learning, I took classes in Mathematics, Open Data Research, Animation, Game Art and Programming, Photography, Philosophy, Psychology, and a few more. 
									I excelled in my computer science classes. I became a teaching assistant for <a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=CS%20281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS281 (Systems Architecture)</a> and <a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=CS+375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS375 (Web Development)</a>. 
									<br />
									<br />
									Some of my favorite classes include (but are not limited to) - 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=CS+380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS380 (Artificial Intelligence)</a>, 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=CS+383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS383 (Machine Learning)</a>, 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=CS+260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS260 (Data Structures)</a>, 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=VRIM+100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VRIM100 (Digital Tools for AR/VR)</a>, 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=PHIL+351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHIL351 (Philosophy of Technology)</a>, and 
									<a href="https://catalog.drexel.edu/search/?P=PHIL+311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHIL311 (Ethics and Information Technology)</a>.
									<br />
									<br />
								</p>
								<li><h4>What I like doing outside of class</h4></li>
								<p>
									Outside classes, I love traveling, photography (check out my Instagram), working out, and playing sports. I played football (soccer) and tennis throughout my time in high school. 
									<br />
									<br />
									<!--Remember to add pictures here-->
									At the start of Drexel, I challenged myself to pick up fencing and became a part of the Drexel Fencing Club. 
									Through hard work, dedication, and tenacity, I got 3rd at the BWCFC fencing championships consisting of 13 schools from the east coast. 
									As a team, we secured the 2nd position for my weapon type, Epee. 
									Beyond fencing, I'm also a member of Drexel Speaks (public speaking club) and the Drexel E-Sports and Gaming Association.
									<br />
									<br />
									At DPS Noida, I was part of the highly selective Photography Club, the Debate Club, and an active eSpice (Computer Club) member. 
									I represented DPS Noida at multiple competitions as a member of the three clubs.
